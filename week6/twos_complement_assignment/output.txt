Two's Complement Representation (8-bit)
=====================================

(a) +32: 00100000
(b) -14: 11110010 (Two's complement of 14)
(c) +63: 00111111
(d) -104: 10011000 (Two's complement of 104)
(e) +127: 01111111
(f) -127: 10000001 (Two's complement of 127)
(g) +89: 01011001
(h) -55: 11001001 (Two's complement of 55)
(i) -1: 11111111 (Two's complement of 1)
(j) -128: 10000000 (Two's complement of 128)
(k) +169: Cannot be represented in 8-bit two's complement (out of range)
(l) +0: 00000000
(m) +84: 01010100
(n) +3: 00000011
(o) -3: 11111101 (Two's complement of 3)
(p) -190: Cannot be represented in 8-bit two's complement (out of range)

Notes:
- 8-bit two's complement range: -128 to +127
- MSB (leftmost bit) is the sign bit: 0 = positive, 1 = negative
- For negative numbers, two's complement = invert all bits + 1
